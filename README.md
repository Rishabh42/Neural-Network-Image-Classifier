## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

**1. Run Jupyter Notebooks:**
* Launch Jupyter Notebook in the project directory:
```
jupyter notebook
```
* Open the relevant Jupyter notebooks, such as:
  - `experiments.ipynb` - contains all of the linear and logistic regression experiments
  - `data_analysis/boston_analysis.ipynb`
  - `data_analysis/wine_analysis.ipynb`
  
**2. Explore the Code:**
* Review the codebase:
  - `models/models.py` - contains the linear and logistic regression models
  - `models/optimizers.py` - contains the optimizers (SGD and Adam)
 
**3. Customize and Experiment:**
